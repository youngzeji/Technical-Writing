## **Development tools**
Have you ever taught about why some developers would refer to react.js or vue.js as a library and other developers would refer to them as a framework; well, there is a reason and the are firstly referred to as development tools.

Development tools are tools that supports the swift implementation of software applications on a programming platform. This means the development kits, programming tools, emulators and other materials that are used in the development of a website, app, Game and software. This tools make it easier for the developer to get the app or software built and deployed. Application development tools can be categorized into the following:
- version control tools
- libraries
- frameworks
- a build tool
- continuous integration CI and continuous delivery CD  
- packages and package manager

### **Version Control Tools**
Version control tools are systems that help devops teams work faster and smarter. They are also known as source control. Version control is the method of tracking software codes and managing them. This version control systems keep track of every code modification in a cloud database. 

This version control systems are in control of managing changes to computer programs, large websites, documents and other collections of information. Version control is used in managing and protecting the source code, keeping track of all the modifications made to the code, comparing earlier versions of the code. Some version control systems include:
- Git
- Apache Subversion
- Mercurial
- Perforce
- Azure Devops Server, etc

### **Libraries**
A library is a collection of stable resources used by computer programs for software development. Libraries can also be seen as an assembly of pre-written code that users can use to optimize tasks.

Libraries provide developers with already defined functions and classes to make software development easier and boost the development process. These may include configuration data, pre-written and  subroutines, classes, type specifications, documentation, help data and message templates. For example you might want to include a navigational feature, like  Carousel, a code library can supply you with the code for that so that you do not have to spend the time and energy to start creating one from Scratch.

Being able to access code in this way makes developing your app much Quicker and easier.Most if not all programming languages have there custom libraries while some share same libraries. Here are some programming languages and there Example libraries:
- Java; libraries here include apache commons, Java standard libraries(jackson), Maven and Json.
- Python; Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Keras, Pandas and Pytorch.
- Javascript; jQuery, React, angular, AngularJs, Lodash, Bootstrap.
- CSS; Blueprint, Bulma, Sass, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap.

### **Frameworks**
A framework is a set of tools in programming on which developers build structured, reliable software and systems. Frameworks provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized to speed up development. 

You can think of a framework as being a skeleton that you can expand or develop by adding your own code. Frameworks are like scaffold on which to build your apps. The framework you have chosen to work with determines which subroutines and methods would be called and therefore determines the architecture of your program work flow. A framework can include compilers, code libraries, tool sets, APIs to develop software and create systems. 

Frameworks often include libraries which they can call when needed. Frameworks are less flexible than Libraries, allowing you less control, which is known as inversion of control because it feels like you the developer are not in full control of the development process. Here are some programming languages and there frameworks:
- Java; Spring, vaadin, Appfuse, Grails, Apache wicket, Play.
- Pyhton; Django, Flask, CherryPy, TurboGears.
- Javascript; Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Express.js, Next.js, React, Meteor.
- CSS; Bootstrap, Tailwind, Pure, Water, Bulma, Foundation, Skeleton.

### **A Build Tool**
A build tools are systems that automate the process of modeling an executable application from source code. The modeling or building process includes processes like compiling, linking and packaging the code into an executable form. Build tools transforms your source code into the binaries needed for installation. 

Build tools Organize your source code, set compile flags and manage dependencies. They are most important in environments with many inter-connected projects, with multiple developers contributing to each project. Build tools could be initiated from the Command line or an IDE. There are two types of Build tools;  

**Build-automation utilities** which generate and build artifacts like executables by compiling and linking source code.

**Build-automation servers** which execute build-automation utilities on a scheduled or triggered basis. Example of some Build tools;
- Gradle
- Bower
- Terraform
- Apache Ant
- Apache Maven
- NAnt
- Docker


### **Continuous integration CI and Continuous delivery CD**
Continuous integration and continuous delivery tools are softwares that leverage automation to support software development and speed up software delivery to users. Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that all the code components work together smoothly. The CI process automatically builds and test your code, while Continuous Delivery (CD) deploys all changes to the code in a build to staging or testing environment. 

Continuous Integration is coding idealogy that drives development teams to constantly execute small code changes and commit them into a version control repository. Continuous Delivery begins from where continuous integration stops its an automated way to deliver code changes to selected environments which include production, development, and testing environments.   Example of CI/CD tools include;
- Gitlab
- AWS CodeDeploy
- Bamboo
- Jenkins
- JetBrains TeamCity
- CircleCI 

### **Packages and Package Manager**
A package is a archive of files that contain directories and instructions for installations required for a software product, and is usually designed and built by the software developer after completing the development of the software code. Packages have their own metadata which include the package description, package version, and any dependencies, like other packages that need to be installed beforehand. Once you have stacked your app into a package, you can use a package manager to distribute it.

Package manager is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and uninstalling of computer programs for a computer at the users request. Package managers verify digital certificates to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the package, locate, download, install and update software from a software repository. Example of package managers for each platform;
- Linux; sources.list, DPKG, RPM, DNF, slackpkg, yum, pacman.
- windows; chocolatey, homebrew, pacman, DNF, windows package manager, APT.
- MacOS; Homebrew, MacPorts, Npm, NuGet, Portage, Powershell.

### **Summary**
In this Article we have learnt about application development tools which are used to enhance the swift build of softwares. This tools are further categorized into the following:
- Version controls
- libraries
- frameworks
- build tools
- CI/CD
- packages and package managers
